# glasses_index-SGI
We proposed a new SeaGrass Index (SGI) for automatic and rapid mapping of Z. japonica based on time-series Landsat satellite imagery, aiming to alleviate the influence of tidal inundation and enhance the separability from other coastal cover types, the SGI considers both spectral and phenological characteristics of Z. japonica, Based on SGI, Z. japonica seagrass were extracted using multi-Otsu thresholding algorithm. We carried out Landsat Image Preprocessing and SGI construction on the remote sensing cloud platform of Google Earth engine (GEE), the method can be reproduced with the following GEE code URL: https://code.earthengine.google.com/f0a140a94986d3be5931c9a4b7277828 and GEE_seagrass.js file, the code for classifying SGI images using the multiotsu method is in multi_Otsu.py file.
